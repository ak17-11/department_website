                The Computer Culture at the Panjab University dates back to
                1966. An independent Centre for Computer Science and
                Applications (now a full fledged department) was set-up in 1983.
                The department aims at ingraining the spirit of ingenuity,
                innovativeness and technical competence in the students through
                rigorous competition and regular guidance. The department also
                caters to the need of users in the region and organizes
                programmes for teaching and research communities.
